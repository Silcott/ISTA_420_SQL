-- 1. Use a derived table to build a query that returns the number of distinct products per year that each
-- customer ordered. Use internal aliasing. Use a variable to set the customer number. For example, if
-- the customer ID is 1234, the query should report the number of distinct products ordered by customer
-- 1234 for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016.





-- 2. Use multiple common table expressions to build a query that returns the number of distinct products
-- per year that each country's customers ordered. Use external aliasing. Use a variable to set the country
-- name. For example, if the country name is France, the query should report the number of distinct
-- products ordered by French customers for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016.




-- 3. Create a view that shows, for each year, the total dollar amount spent by customers in each country
-- for all the years in the database.





-- 4. Create an inline table valued function that accepts as a parameter a country name and returns a table
-- with the distinct products ordered by customers from that country. Products are to be identied by
-- both product ID and product name.






-- 5. Use the CROSS APPLY operator to create a query showing the top three products shipped to customers
-- in each country. Your report should contain the name of the country, the product id, the product name,
-- and the number of products shipped to customers in that country.
