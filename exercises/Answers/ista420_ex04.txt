-- 1. Use a derived table to build a query that returns the number of distinct products per year that each
-- customer ordered. Use internal aliasing. Use a variable to set the customer number. For example, if
-- the customer ID is 1234, the query should report the number of distinct products ordered by customer
-- 1234 for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016.

select e.empid, e.firstname, e.lastname from HR.Employees e where e.empid NOT in (select distinct o.empid from Sales.Orders o where o.orderdate >= '2014-01-01');

-- 2. Use multiple common table expressions to build a query that returns the number of distinct products
-- per year that each country's customers ordered. Use external aliasing. Use a variable to set the country
-- name. For example, if the country name is France, the query should report the number of distinct
-- products ordered by French customers for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016.
select distinct c.country from sales.customers c 
	where c.country NOT in 
	(select distinct e.country from HR.Employees e);select 


-- 3. Create a view that shows, for each year, the total dollar amount spent by customers in each country
-- for all the years in the database.

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS Sales.VEmpOrders;
GO
CREATE VIEW Sales.VEmpOrders
AS
SELECT
empid,
YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear,
SUM(qty) AS qty
FROM Sales.Orders AS O
INNER JOIN Sales.OrderDetails AS OD
ON O.orderid = OD.orderid
GROUP BY
empid,
YEAR(orderdate);


-- 4. Create an inline table valued function that accepts as a parameter a country name and returns a table
-- with the distinct products ordered by customers from that country. Products are to be identied by
-- both product ID and product name.

CREATE FUNCTION Production.TopProducts
(@supid AS INT, @n AS INT)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
SELECT TOP (@n) productid, productname, unitprice
FROM Production.Products
WHERE supplierid = @supid
ORDER BY unitprice DESC;




-- 5. Use the CROSS APPLY operator to create a query showing the top three products shipped to customers
-- in each country. Your report should contain the name of the country, the product id, the product name,
-- and the number of products shipped to customers in that country.

SELECT S.supplierid, S.companyname, P.productid, P.productname, P.unitprice
FROM Production.Suppliers AS S
CROSS APPLY Production.TopProducts(S.supplierid, 3) AS P;
