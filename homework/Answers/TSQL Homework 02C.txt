1. List the date/time types in T-SQL.
DATETIME
SMALLDATETIME
DATE
TIME
DATETIME
DATETIMEOFFSET

2. How do you express a date/time literal in T-SQL?
T-SQL doesn’t provide the means to express a date
and time literal; instead, you can specify a literal of a different type that can be converted—explicitly or
implicitly—to a date and time data type. It is a best practice to use character strings to express date and
time values, as shown in the following example:

SELECT orderid, custid, empid, orderdate
FROM Sales.Orders
WHERE orderdate = '20160212';


3. What is the setting DATEFORMAT used for?
Note that the LANGUAGE/DATEFORMAT setting affects only the way the values you enter are interpreted; 
these settings have no impact on the format used in the output for presentation purposes.
Output format is determined by the database interface used by the client tool (such as ODBC) 
and not by the LANGUAGE/
DATEFORMAT setting. For example, OLE DB and ODBC present DATE values in the format ‘YYYY-
MM-DD’.


4. Write a T-SQL snippet changing the date format to German. Read the documentation on how to do
this.
SET LANGUAGE German;
SELECT CAST('20160212' AS DATE);


5. What is the dierence between CAST(), CONVERT(), and PARSE()?
, CAST, CONVERT, and PARSE are used to convert one data type into another in SQL Server, 
there are some subtle differences between them. The  CAST method accepts just two parameters,
expression, and target type, but CONVERT() also takes a third parameter representing the format 
of conversion, which is supported for some conversions, like between character strings and date-time 
values. For example, CONVERT(DATE, '2/7/2015', 101) converts the character string '2/7/2015' to DATE 
using DATE format 101, representing United States standard.

By using the PARSE function, you can also indicate the culture by using any culture supported by 
Microsoft's dot NET framework. For example, PARSE('7/8/2015' AS DATE USING 'en-US') parse the input 
literal as a DATE by using a United States English Culture, similar to 101 formatting style.

6. What function returns the current date? This is very useful in a table that maintains a log of events,
such as user logins.
SELECT CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(CHAR(12), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 114), 114);


7. How do you add one day to the current date? Add one week? Add one month? Add one year?
SELECT DATEADD(day, 1, '20160212');


8. Write a SQL snippet to return the number of years between your birth date and today's date.
SELECT DATEDIFF(year, '197804119', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);


9. How do you check a string literal to see if it represents a valid date?
To check the validity of the data, write a query


10. What does EOMONTH() do? Give an example of why this might be very useful.
The EOMONTH function accepts an input date and time value and returns the respective end-of-
month date as a DATE typed value. The function also supports an optional second argument indicating
how many months to add (or subtract, if negative).
advantage that you can use it to compute the begin-
ning or end of other parts (day, month, quarter, year).

11. Payments are due exactly 30 days from the date of the last function. Write a select query that calculates
the date of the next payment. Pretend we want to update a column in a database that contains the
date of the next payment. We will do this when we write UPDATE queries.

12. Suppose your son or daughter wants to run a query every day that tells them the number of days until
their 16th birthday. Write a select query that does this.


SELECT name,
       DATEDIFF(day, 20110727 as sonsBDAY, DATEADD(year, 16, sonsBDAY) as ageSixteen)  
         AS totalDayOld
FROM dates;
