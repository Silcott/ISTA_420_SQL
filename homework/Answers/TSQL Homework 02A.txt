1. List the order of execution of a SQL query
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT
ORDER BY
*Start with SELECT.  Reason why? Book says it's more like English language and so you can start with what you are working with.

2. What does the FROM clause do?
The FROM clause is the very first query clause that is logically processed. In this clause, you specify the
names of the tables you want to query and table operators that operate on those tables. 
*Grabs every single row in a table.
*example Sales.Orders
*Sales is the schmea and Orders is the table
[Database]Schema.Table


3. What does the WHERE clause do?
In the WHERE clause, you specify a predicate or logical expression to filter the rows returned by the
FROM phase
*Predicate evalutes if the value is true
*Where clause has a predicate that either evaluates to true or false and the database looks at the 
*fields and if the value in that field is false then athat value is discarded

4. What does the GROUP BY clause do?
You can use the GROUP BY phase to arrange the rows returned by the previous logical query pro-
cessing phase in groups. The groups are determined by the elements you specify in the GROUP BY
clause.  
*Combines the rows into a set (unique values, no duplicates) mathematically after excution as specfied
*Combines rows into groups according to specification you pass through
*Can only select attricutest hat you selcet by the group by clause 

5. What does HAVING clause do?
Whereas the WHERE clause is a row filter, the HAVING clause is a group filter. Only groups for which
the HAVING predicate evaluates to TRUE are returned by the HAVING phase to the next logical query
processing phase. Groups for which the predicate evaluates to FALSE or UNKNOWN are discarded
*Group filter, returns true or false
*COUNT counts all the rows in each group and 
*example HAVING COUNT(*) >1
*COUNT is the predicate, if the count of number of rows is greater than one then it returns that group 
(not the number of rows)

6. What does SELECT clause do?
The SELECT clause is where you specify the attributes (columns) you want to return in the result table of
the query. You can base the expressions in the SELECT list on attributes from the queried tables, with or
without further manipulation.

7. What does DISTINCT keyword do?
SQL provides the means to remove duplicates using the DISTINCT clause (as shown in Listing 2-3)
and, in this sense, return a relational result
*Returns only distinct values, which is the first one the computer sees and you don't know which one you'll get

8. What does the ORDER BY clause do?
You use the ORDER BY clause to sort the rows in the output for presentation purposes. In terms of
logical query processing, ORDER BY is the very last clause to be processed
*sorts the records for the human being ont he other end, nothing to do witht hte query

9. What does the LIMIT clause do?
SQL | LIMIT Clause
The LIMIT clause is used to set an upper limit on the number of tuples returned by SQL.
It is important to note that this clause is not supported by all SQL versions.
The LIMIT clause can also be specified using the SQL 2008 OFFSET/FETCH FIRST clauses.
The limit/offset expressions must be a non-negative integer.
*Sets a upper limit

10. What does the TOP clause do?
The TOP filter is a proprietary T-SQL feature you can use to limit the number or percentage of rows
your query returns.
*Does the same thing as the LIMIT clause and the LIMIT clause is not implemented in Microsoft SQL program and TOP clause is 
*Goes into the SELECT clause

11. What doest he offset...fetch do?
The OFFSET-FETCH filter is considered an extension to the ORDER BY clause. 
With the OFFSET clause you indicate how many rows to skip, and with the FETCH clause you indicate how many rows to filter
after the skipped rows.
*Can have a offset without fetch, but not the other way around because it would do the same thing as TOP or LIMIT does
