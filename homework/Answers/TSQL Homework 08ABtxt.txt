Chapter 8: pages 266-287
1. The sales tax rate for a state just changed. How would you update the state sales tax table to reflect
the changes? Assume that this table has an ID column, an RATE column, and a STATE column.

UPDATE dbo.OrderDetails
SET stateTax = stateTax * 1.08
WHERE state = Maryland




2. The Revenue Division has requested that you provide a report on what the actual sales taxes would
have been for all orders in the past year, assuming the retroactivity of the new sales tax rate. How
would you calculate this?

UPDATE OD
SET stateTax += 8
FROM dbo.OrderDetails AS OD
INNER JOIN dbo.Orders AS O
ON OD.stateTax = O.stateTax
WHERE O.id = 1;



3. Explain how the proprietary assignment update command works.
proprietary UPDATE syntax that both updates data in a table and assigns values
to variables at the same time. This syntax saves you the need to use separate UPDATE and SELECT
statements to achieve the same task.

common cases for which you can use this syntax is in maintaining a custom sequence/
autonumbering mechanism when the identity column property and the sequence object donâ€™t work
for you. One example is when you need to guarantee that there are no gaps between the values. To
achieve this, you keep the last-used value in a table, and whenever you need a new value, you use the
special UPDATE syntax to both increment the value in the table and assign it to a variable


4. What is one very important purpose of the MERGE SQL statement? What is ETL (not in book)?

the combination of three INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE statements. 
So if there is a Source table and a Target table that are to be merged,
then with the help of MERGE statement, all the three operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) can be performed at once.

ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load, which is a process used to collect data from various sources, 
transform the data depending on business rules/needs and load the data into a destination database.

5. What are the semantics of MERGE?

MERGE target_table USING source_table
ON merge_condition
WHEN MATCHED
    THEN update_statement
WHEN NOT MATCHED
    THEN insert_statement
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE
    THEN DELETE;


6. Write a typical INSERT OUTPUT statement.

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(datacol)
OUTPUT inserted.keycol, inserted.datacol
INTO @NewRows(keycol, datacol)
SELECT lastname
FROM HR.Employees
WHERE country = N'UK';



7. Write a typical UPDATE OUTPUT statement.

UPDATE dbo.OrderDetails
SET discount += 0.05
OUTPUT
inserted.orderid,
inserted.productid,
deleted.discount AS olddiscount,
inserted.discount AS newdiscount
WHERE productid = 51;



8. Write a typical DELETE OUTPUT statement.

DELETE FROM dbo.Orders
OUTPUT
deleted.orderid,
deleted.orderdate,
deleted.empid,
deleted.custid
WHERE orderdate < '20160101';



9. Write a typical MERGE OUTPUT statement.

MERGE INTO dbo.Customers AS TGT
USING dbo.CustomersStage AS SRC
ON TGT.custid = SRC.custid
WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET
TGT.companyname = SRC.companyname,
TGT.phone = SRC.phone,
TGT.address = SRC.address
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN


10. What is nested DML?

T-SQL supports a feature called
nested DML you can use to directly insert into the final 
target table only the subset of rows you need
from the full set of modified rows.


11. (Not in book) Write a query adding a new column to a table named PERSON. The new column name
is DayOfBirth and the data type is string. Use ANSI SQL syntax.






12. (Not in book) Write a query adding a DEFAULT constraint to the column DayOfBirth. The constraint
is that the value matches one of SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, or SAT.






13. (Not in book) Write a query adding a foreign key to the column DayOfBirth. The referenced table is
named WEEK and the referenced column is ValidDay.
